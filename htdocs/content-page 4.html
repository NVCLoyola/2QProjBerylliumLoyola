                Duterte has approved the reimplementation of face-to-face classes in areas deemed low risk by DOH with up to 120 schools to join a two-month pilot reopening run. 
                The pilot will cover 100 public schools and 20 private institutions with class size limited to 12 learners in kindergarten, 16 in Grades 1-3, and 20 at Senior Highschool. 
                Aside from being low risked areas, these schools must have passed the safety assessment using the school safety assessment tool of DepEd and have the support of the local government unit in the form of a resolution or letter of support.
                This pilot isn't full-on f2f since it will be a combination of face-to-face classes in school and distance learning modalities for two months. The aforementioned classes shall be conducted 
                half-day every other week, with participating schools ensuring that class schedules are arranged equitably so that all qualified learners have the opportunity to attend face-to-face classes.			
                On the other hand, the Commision on Higher Education (CHED) said in-person classes are currently available for certain degree programs like tourism and medical degrees in areas under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).
                CHED also stated that f2f classes may soon be allowed regardless of the student's course if the school is located in an area with very low COVID-19 prevalence and a very high vaccination rate.

                Here we have four countries. The top right photo shows Israeli students lining up without social distancing, Swedish students graduating on the bottom right, Japanese students in a classroom on the top left, and Uruguayan teacher with students having a class on the bottom right. 
                Israel’s vaccination and Covid response is praised worldwide but they reimplemented f2f classes immediately in a very lax way causing a steep rise in Covid cases that included students and teachers.
                Sweden’s Covid response is nothing short of experimental because it didn’t declare a lockdown, implemented optional but recommended wearing of face masks and social distancing, and the government even threatened to punish parents that didn’t want to send their kids to school! 
                Though there isn’t a strong rise of Covid cases in the country, it has a high death rate up to 10x higher than its Norwegian neighbor and it’s economic gamble didn’t pay off since it still had a -2.8% GDP growth.
                Japan is on the top left while Uruguay is on the bottom left. Both of these countries have great safety protocols when it comes to f2f classes that paid off really well. 
                However, Japan’s policy though effective is not well-received by the populace while Uruguayans are known for having strong faith in their government and a very consistent and early adoption of safety protocols.
                In the end, it’s fairly obvious that Uruguayans are the optimum role model in this set of  four countries when it comes to reimplementing face to face classes.

          <h3>My Opinions on Our Country's Plans on Reimplementation</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our country's plan on reimplementation isn't quite polished yet but we must not rush it or else we'll end up like Israel.
            </li>
						<li>
              We must take safety protocols very seriously like Uruguay and Japan or else we'll be like Israel who's lax policies ended up ruining them.
            </li>
						<li>
              Even if f2f classes returns, we must still impose strict lockdown measures. As a matter of fact, this "no lockdown" strategy only worked for Sweden because of their small population density. If the Philippines (which has a high population density) decides to adopt this, we'll be in great danger.
            </li>
						<li>
              Though Japan has great safety protocols, the subordination of its people lessen its effects. Filipinos must look up to the people that have the best regulations in these set of countries, Uruguayans, when following government
						safety and f2f protocols to ensure a smoother and safer return of f2f classes.
            </li>
						<li>
              Pilot testing (and initial f2f classes) should have been conducted first on highschool students and college students because they have a lower risk of contracting the virus when compared to elementary and kinder students plus they could easily join the workforce.
            </li>	
						<li>
              Despite the fact that students need to have f2f classes as soon as possible for education's sake, it is better for limited face to face classes to start in the next school year
						since there should be a smooth transition and we must have a longer pilot testing than two months.
            </li>
						<li>
              We should have four months of pilot testing instead of two. More specifically, we must have the first two months of pilot testing for higher grade levels and the latter two for the lower grade levels.
            </li>
						<li>
              Carry out more vaccination campaigns to further protect the masses from Covid-19.
            </li>
						<li>
              Instead of having the typical two-month summer vacation, we must have make-up classes on the subjects of S.Y. 2020-2021 because students barely learned anything.</li>
