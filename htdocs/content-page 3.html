              Before I talk about my opinions, I would tell you my experience in the last school year (accompanied by the photo of my grades per quarter) in order for you to understand what shaped my opinions. 
			  At first glance, those grades seem above average but there is a deeper story behind it all.  Even though it is not the quarter with the lowest grade, the first quarter is definitely the worst of them all. 
			  This is the case since I sustained an NG (No Grade) in Computer Science due to my laid-back approach in answering reqs. Even though the effects of the NG are neutralized by submitting the needed requirements, 
			  it still haunts me since it reminds me of the failure I could've easily avoided if I focused more on reqs. The second quarter is the lowest and perhaps the second worst quarter since my grade dipped.
			  Even though I worked harder in this quarter, my grade still plummeted since my laid-back persona prevailed in the latter half of the quarter. This setback in the second quarter, prompted me to work much harder 
			  in the third quarter that really paid off. It might be fairly obvious that the fourth is my favorite because of my high grades. However, the main reason I love it is the fact that Pisay made this quarter 
			  really easy since only a few subjects have real "requirements" since workload from some subjects can only be answered if you choose to improve your grade. Throughout the school year, I also lived in constant fear 
			  of contracting the virus since several of our distant relatives who lived a few blocks away contracted it. This experiences made my opinion center around having a slow but safe return of f2f classes 
			  and organizing a recap of the lessons tackled during the online and f2f years.

          <h3>My Opinions on Our Country's Plans on Reimplementation</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <ul class="col-6">
            <li>
              Our country's plan on reimplementation isn't quite polished yet but we must not rush it. Rushing it will leave us in a state worse than Israel due to certain conditions in our country like a higher population. 
			  Even though Israel is one of the worst performers in initial f2f reimplementation, it is still a role model in vaccination since it is one of the first countries to reach herd immunity. In fact, the first picture 
			  shows Benjamin Netanyahu (Israel's former prime minister) as the first Israeli to be vaccinated on December 19, 2020. 
            </li>
						<li>
              Once reimplementation begins, we must implement strict safety protocols like Uruguay and Japan. Doing the opposite will make us like Israel who's lax policies ended up ruining them.
			  If the Filipino students on the second picture can follow decently strict safety protocols, every Filipino student can also do the same.
            </li>
						<li>
              Even if f2f classes returns, we must still impose strict lockdown measures. As a matter of fact, this "no lockdown" strategy only "worked" for Sweden because of their small population density. If the Philippines (which has a high population density) decides to adopt this, we'll be in great danger.
			  Take a look at the third photo and you'll see Swedes not wearing masks as if the pandemic doesn't even exist. 
            </li>
						<li>
			  Both Japan and Uruguay have strict government protocols but Japan's populace is still hesitant about the otherwise efficient safety protocols so Filipinos must look up to Uruguayans since their obedience in following government safety and f2f protocols ensured a smoother and safer return of f2f classes.
            </li>

		  <div id="important-ul" class="col-12 col-s-12">
		  <ul>
						<li>Pilot testing (and initial f2f classes) should have been conducted on highschool students and college students first because they have a lower risk of contracting the virus when compared to elementary and kinder students. Another advantage is the fact that they could easily join the workforce particularly the senior highschool and sollege students.</li>	
						<li>We should have two months of pilot testing instead of one. More specifically, we must have the first two months of pilot testing for higher grade levels and the latter two for the lower grade levels. This is the case due to the fact that lower grade levels should have a pilot testing dedicated to them since
				most (if not, all) students from lower grade levels aren't vaccinated since vaccine roll-outs for their age group aren't (if not, barely) available yet.
				</li>
						<li>Carrying out more vaccination campaigns should be a priority to further protect the masses from Covid-19. Forcibly vaccinating every Filipino is a violation of personal freedom but we must at least convince them to get a vaccine via vaccination campaigns.</li>
						<li>Instead of having the typical two-month summer vacation in 2023 and 2024, we must have make-up classes on the subjects of S.Y. 2020-2021 and S.Y. 2021-2022 because students barely learned anything in the online set-up.</li>
